# Inventory
This is a data wrangling / extraction project that I have completed to solve a problem with inventory traceability. An inventory tracking system for an organization could only generate reports with current inventory status but, never keeps a record of inventory historically. This caused an issue because inventory status could not be tracked over time. So, to solve this problem, I have written this code in R to import inventory reports then merge them into one file. This then could be used in R for visual representation or exported to a spreadsheet. In this example, I have attached what each inventory report looked like before extraction (Weekly_Inventory) & what the visualization of inventory tracking over time after extraction on a chart looks like (Extracted Inventory).
